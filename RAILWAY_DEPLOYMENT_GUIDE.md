# ðŸš‚ Railway Deployment Guide for Telegram Scheduler Bot

## Prerequisites
- GitHub account

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Prepare Your Repository

Your repository now includes all necessary files:
- âœ… `railway.toml` - Railway configuration
- âœ… `Procfile` - Alternative process definition
- âœ… `.gitignore` - Excludes sensitive files
- âœ… `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- âœ… All bot source code

### 2. Commit and Push to GitHub

```bash
# Add all files (excluding those in .gitignore)
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Add Railway deployment configuration"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### 3. Deploy to Railway

   - Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Sign up with your GitHub account

2. **Create New Project**
   - Click "New Project"

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - In Railway dashboard, go to your project

   - Monitor the deployment in the "Deployments" tab

### 4. Verify Deployment

   - Ensure no errors appear

2. **Test Bot**

   - Send `/start` command
   - Try setting a schedule: `/setschedule 14:30 Test message`
